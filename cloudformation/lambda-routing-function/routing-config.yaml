# Example Routing Configuration
# This file demonstrates how to configure routing for different applications
# to specific Bedrock agents and knowledge bases.

# List of available Bedrock agents
agents:
  - "AGENT_ID_1"
  - "AGENT_ID_2"
  - "AGENT_ID_3"

# List of available knowledge bases
knowledge_bases:
  - "KB_ID_1"
  - "KB_ID_2"
  - "KB_ID_3"

# Default agent to use if no specific routing rule matches
default_agent: "AGENT_ID_1"

# Routing rules per application
# Each application can be routed to a specific agent and knowledge base
routing_rules:
  webapp1:
    agent: "AGENT_ID_1"
    knowledge_base: "KB_ID_1"
    model_id: "anthropic.claude-v2"  # Optional: specific model override
  
  webapp2:
    agent: "AGENT_ID_2"
    knowledge_base: "KB_ID_2"
    model_id: "anthropic.claude-v2"
  
  webapp3:
    agent: "AGENT_ID_3"
    knowledge_base: "KB_ID_3"
    model_id: "amazon.titan-text-express-v1"
  
  default:
    agent: "AGENT_ID_1"
    knowledge_base: "KB_ID_1"

# Advanced routing based on request attributes
# You can extend this to route based on:
# - Request path
# - User attributes
# - Request content type
# - Time of day
# - Geographic location
